A simple Python weather program using the TKInter GUI library and an API key from https://www.weatherapi.com. 
I created this app to get advanced knowledge of GUI creation and API key calls, because these topics have not yet been covered in my classes.
This program requires the Python "requests" library. To install this, you can run on the command line:
$ python -m pip install requests
